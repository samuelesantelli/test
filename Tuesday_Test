# Tuesday Test exercise  

Here we can code many nice things:

Imo this works, now you have to transfer it to ** bold **  

Secondly, we need to add two equations (in an unordered list):  

*Equation 1:  
+$ CV = mean/sd $  
+$ \sigma = \sqrt{ln(CV^{2}+1)}  $ I'm not sure this equation is correct. It should be -1

Done :)
